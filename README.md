## U18 and U19 roms (phatroms compiled for IntelInboard/386 PC)
(press the ... beside the commit for full details)
basically, I compiled it without the turbo hotkey, since there is already a turbo hotkey built into the Inboard, plus the TurboXT capability is superflous on an Inboard.
```
TURBO_ENABLED   = 0             ; Define to enable "turbo" support
TURBO_BOOT      = 0             ; Define to boot up in turbo mode (full speed)
TURBO_HOTKEY    = 0             ; Define to enable "CTRL ALT -" hotkey to toggle turbo mode
```
